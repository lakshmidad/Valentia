## 🎨 Design Philosophy
*   **Visuals**: High-end, "wow" factor. Glassmorphism, smooth gradients, and subtle micro-interactions.
*   **Typography**: Premium Google Fonts (e.g., Great Vibes for headers, Inter/Outfit for body).
*   **Feedback**: Every button click and interaction should have satisfying haptic/visual feedback.
